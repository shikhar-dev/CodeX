# CodeX
* Detailed solutions to various competitive programming problems across various platforms.
* Contains solutions to various problems on LeetCode and Codefoces platforms.
* For Codeforces platforms, the folder contains the scripts to pull your solution specific data(analyses such number of attempts, time, memory, question difficulty etc.) and puts the stats in a file along with your accepted code and then puts both files in folder names after the contest Id in which these problems appeared. This action uses Codeforces API.
* For LeetCode The script only makes a new file with question name and URL(as Leetcode does not exposes APIs)

# Up next
* Working on making the python script for codeforces as a chrome extension so that whenever user makes an AC submission the data is automatically pulled and pushed to github.
